# Minecraft Deathmatch
Fight to the death in this fast-paced minigame!

## Game Rules
All players randomly spawn within the border. 
The border will eventually start shrinking, and players will take damage if they step outside the border.
The player's job is to collect resources and fend off others.
Each player starts with 60 seconds of Speed II, but will lose it if they hit another player.
Killing another player will reward the killer 1 golden apple. Last player standing wins!
